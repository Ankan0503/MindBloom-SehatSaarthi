# 🌸 MindBloom - SehatSaarthi
**MindBloom-SehatSaarthi:** Your personal **"Health Charioteer"**. It is a comprehensive health ecosystem designed to harmonize the mind and body. While our primary focus is on mental resilience, we recognize that true well-being is incomplete without physical vitality.

- **MindBloom** is a holistic mental health tracking and support platform designed to empower individuals in their journey toward better emotional well-being. By combining self-reflection tools with accessible guidance, we aim to bridge the gap between daily stress management and professional mental health support.
- **SehatSaarthi** serves as the physical health companion. It acts as a guide to bridge the connection between physical symptoms and overall health, ensuring users maintain the physical stamina required for mental well-being.

## 🎯 Our Aim

Our primary goal is to **destigmatize mental health care** and make self-help tools accessible to everyone. We aim to:
- Provide a safe, private space for users to express their thoughts.
- Visualize mental health trends to help users understand their triggers.
- Offer immediate, companion-like support to navigate stressful situations.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 📋 Intelligent Assessment Engine (Core Feature)
This feature allows users to take a deep dive into their mental state. It combines free-text expression—where users describe their feelings—with structured assessment questions for a complete evaluation. 
The system processes these responses to detect patterns of stress and anxiety, offering users immediate insights into their emotional health and guiding them toward the right wellness tools. The assessment data is stored according to their pincode.

### 2. 🗺️ StressMap (Geospatial Analytics)
A data-driven visualization tool that maps collective well-being across India. By aggregating anonymous assessment data linked to **pincodes**, we generate a dynamic heatmap of the country. Regions are color-coded to represent average stress levels:
- 🟢 **Green:** Low Stress
- 🟡 **Yellow:** Moderate Stress
- 🟠 **Orange:** High Stress
- 🔴 **Red:** Critical Stress
  
This allows users to visualize community mental health trends and understand the broader emotional climate of their location.

### 3. 📔 Smart Journals
A secure, private digital sanctuary for self-reflection. Beyond simple note-taking, this feature allows users to:
- **Log Daily Thoughts:** A safe space to declutter the mind and process complex emotions.
- **Sentiment Analyser** Analysis of user's specific day's emotions from the journal
- **Track Emotional History:** Store and review past entries to analyze day-to-day mood fluctuations.
- **Identify Patterns:** By looking back at their journey, users can gain self-awareness regarding what triggers their highs and lows.

### 4. 🌏 Community & Peer Support
A safe, moderated space for shared healing. While journaling is private by default, users can **voluntarily share specific entries** with the community to find solidarity.
- **Open Dialogue:** Users can view shared stories and offer support or opinions through comments.
- **Safety First:** To maintain a positive environment, the platform is equipped with an **intelligent comment filter** that automatically detects and blocks content that violates community guidelines.

### 5. 🧘 Holistic Wellness Tools
We provide interactive tools to help users take immediate action for their well-being:
- **Yoga Studio:** A guided section featuring visual references for various yoga poses, complete with a built-in timer to help users maintain their practice and improve physical flexibility.
- **Meditation & Breathing:** Dedicated breathing exercises designed to reduce anxiety in real-time, helping users center themselves and find calm during stressful moments.

### 6. 🩺 SehatSaarthi (Physical Wellness)
Bridging the gap between mental and physical health, this module offers practical, location-based medical utilities:
- **🏥 Hospital Finder:** Utilizing real-time geolocation, this feature scans for all hospitals within a **10km radius** of the user. To facilitate quick decision-making, it automatically ranks and displays the **top 10 closest facilities** sorted by distance.
- **👨‍⚕️ Find a Doctor:** A streamlined medical directory organized by expertise. Users can filter doctors by clicking on specific **specializations** (e.g., Cardiology, Neurology) to instantly view a list of qualified practitioners in that field.

## 💻 Installation Guide

Follow these steps to run **MindBloom-SehatSaarthi** locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python (v3.10 or higher) installed.
- Git installed.
- GDAL Setup
  This project uses **GeoDjango** for the StressMap feature. You must install the GDAL library binaries for your operating system before installing Python requirements.

  **For Windows Only:**
    1. Download and install [OSGeo4W](https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) (Select "Express Web-GIS Install").
    2. After installation, locate the path to `gdalxxx.dll` (usually in `C:\OSGeo4W\bin\gdalxxx.dll` or `C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Local\Programs\OSGeo4W\bin\gdalxxx.dll`). It will be used in `.env` file.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ankan0503/MindBloom-SehatSaarthi.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd MindBloom-SehatSaarthi
   ```
   
3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**
   #### For Windows
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   #### For Linux/Mac
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   
4. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a file named `.env` in the project root directory (same level as `manage.py`). Add your PostgreSQL database credentials (whether local or cloud) and secret key:
     ```env
     SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here # Django Secret Key
     DEBUG=True
   
     # Database Configuration
     DATABASE_NAME=your_database_name
     DATABASE_USER=your_database_user
     DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
     DATABASE_HOST=localhost           # Use 'localhost' for local, or the endpoint URL for cloud
     DATABASE_PORT=5432                # Default PostgreSQL port
   
     ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1

     # GDAL Configuration (WINDOWS ONLY)
     GDAL_LIBRARY_PATH=C:\path\to\your\gdal311.dll 
     ```

   #### Tip: You can generate a secure `SECRET_KEY` by running this command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python -c 'from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())'
   ```

6. **Collect Static Files**

   Gather all static files (CSS, JavaScript, Images) into the `staticfiles` directory to ensure the UI loads correctly:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collecstatic
   ```

7. **Apply Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. **Run the Development Server**
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. **Access the Website:** Open your browser and go to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
